# eduCater

## Catering a healthy education environment for students to be able to freely ask questions about the content with the content.


### Problems we are trying to solve:

	•	professors having a difficult time keeping up with students’ questions
	•	professors not understanding what students are being confused by
	•	decrease of focus during the pandemic
	•	students having trouble making new connections and interacting with each other
	•	students feeling afraid to ask questions in fear that others will think it’s “dumb”

Try it out!
